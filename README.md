Multipurpose CNC milling machine for wood and soft metal

This machine will be primary for wood and plasic milling, but can in special cases be used for
soft metals like aluminium. Special care has to be taken in theese cases, since there is no 
flood cooling, and thereby only dry milling capabilities. There will be an air cooling/chip 
cleaning system with pressurized air as medium.
This machine will have 6 cnc-axes and some special alignment axes for special operations.
X, Y and Z is the normal cartesian axes for spindle movement.
A, B the Euler axises for table roll and pitch.
C is a special feed-through axis where long materials or setups with multiple workpieces 
can be fed beyond the normal Y-axis. This will also be used when a long milling operation
has to be done in the Y-axis without the need for special Y accuracy. This mode will
in some cases require the material to have some unworkable endstock in both ends to satisfy the feeding 
mechanism. It will also, in some cases where high X accuracy is required, have to be 
equipped with special-made soft jaws for the holding mechanism. It will require special 
care regarding the feed mechanism clamping capabilities. A and B axes can normally not 
be used when the C axis is used, but the roll action (a-axis)can be implementet in the feeding 
mechanism. This will be a >360 degree angle movement along the length of the material, 
thus creating a lathe like possibility with the milling tool (Z-axis) as the lathe X-axis 
(Tool in/out axis). Special alignment and reference marks has to be created on the material 
to obtain some better accuracy in the Y-axis.
