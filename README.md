Multipurpose CNC milling machine for wood and soft metal

This machine will have 6 axis:
X, Y, Z is the normal cartesian axes for spindle movement.
A, B the Euler axises for table roll and pitch
C is a special feed-through axis where long materials or setups with multiple workpieces 
can be fed beyond the normal Y axis. This will also be used when a long milling operation
has to be done in the Y axis without the need for special Y accuracy. This mode will
require the material to have unworkable endstock in both ends to satisfy the feeding 
mechanism. It will also in some cases where high X accuracy is required to have special
made soft jaws for the holding mechanism. It will require special care regarding the feed
mechanism clamping capabilities. The A, B axes can normally not be used when the C axis is 
used.
